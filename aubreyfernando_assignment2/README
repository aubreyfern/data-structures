About:
Input.cpp prompts user to enter in a file or generate a cell map.
If they want to enter a file they are prompted for the name of file and the file is read in first 
get dimensions of the array, the array is then made using MakeMap() and then the file is read in again 
to read in the contents of the array and store it in the array made. 
If the user wants to generate a map they are asked to enter in the dimensions for rows
and columns. Correct Input() is used if the entry is not an int and the user is prompted to enter
in a number again. CorrectDensity() does the same thing.

Game.cpp prompts the user whether to print results to a file or 
to the console with the option of pausing between generations or 
outputting all generations at the same time. There is one GameSimulation() method
which has switch statements according to the mode and print type.
